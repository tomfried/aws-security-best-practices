# AWS Best Practices
For all new and existing AWS projects, the following are the minimum best practices I can think for access.

## 1. Immediately Remove Access Key
When you first create an account, if it creates an access key, delete it at: ex: https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/security_credentials. If link does not work, this is found under "Security "
